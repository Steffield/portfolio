            <p>My name is Stephanie Lebby and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer leveraging a background in human communication sciences. In the past, I have worked in hospitals, schools, private practices and universities as speech language pathologist, consultant, educator, lecturer and research assistant. My expertise and research area at that time were in the area of literacy acquisition. During my academic career, I was able to gain experience in using SPSS, SAS and R for data anlysis and to design and present lectures in different areas of speech, language and education.</p>
            <p>I am very excited about creating things that make a difference and eager to combine web development skills with my vast knowledge in communication, literacy and education in the future.  </p>
            <p>As a German native who did her bachelor’s degree in Germany, her master’s degree in England, 30 credits towards a PhD in the US, and traveled the world for a period of time, I offer an open mind, interest and knowledge about different cultures, countries, and languages and am extremely adaptable to new environments and challenges. I love spending time outdoors, traveling or eating Italian food. </p>
